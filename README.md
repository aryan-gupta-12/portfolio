# Aryan Gupta — Portfolio (static)

This repository is a small static portfolio for Aryan Gupta (Senior Associate Consultant — Data Management).
It is built with plain HTML/CSS/JS and intended for deployment on GitHub Pages.

## How to deploy (quick)
1. Create a new public repository named `aryangupta1206.github.io` (or any repo for project pages).
2. Push the files from this repo to the new repository.
3. If repo name is `aryangupta1206.github.io`, GitHub will serve the site at `https://aryangupta1206.github.io`.
4. If using a project repo, go to Settings → Pages → Deploy from `main` branch / `root` folder.
5. (Optional) Add `resume.pdf` and a profile image in `assets/img/`.

## Structure
- `index.html` — main page
- `assets/css/style.css` — styles
- `assets/js/main.js` — small JS helpers
- `resume.pdf` — optional resume file

## Customize
- Replace copy in `index.html` with updated text or links
- Add a real photo at `assets/img` and swap the avatar block
- Add sections (blog, case studies) by copying the `.card` pattern
